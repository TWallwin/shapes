# Ball Game

This is a small project I made using HTML canvas, check it out here : https://tom-wallwin-ball-game.netlify.app/.

It uses requestAnimationFrame and passes in a function that modifys the balls positions with a velocity property of each ball, this velocity changes due to gravtiy every frame and I wrote a simplistic collision system that negates the velocity when two balls intersect.
